it is basically ml project.

Here we use Linear Regression algorithem and OLS model to predict close price of nestle stock and user get the idea to invest in nestle stock or not based on prediction.And in this process we face multicolinearity problems so we use VIF(Variance Inflation Factor) algorithem and get better result.

Then perform Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithem.

Based on EDA and Forecasting Analysis we conclude that It's profitable to buy nestle stock.
